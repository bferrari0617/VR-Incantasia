# VR-Incantasia

My project idea is some kind of generic arena fighting game, but instead of running around with a sword or bow, you would be a wizard casting magic. The main idea I have for the gameplay is that you can cast magic in different and interesting ways. For example, I may want to make it so you trace a symbol in the air in order to cast a spell, or maybe you do a certain hand gesture instead.  

I got this idea from a book series I used to read when I was younger. The main character lived in a world where you had to draw symbols in the air in order for your mana to transform in the right spell, and I always thought that this was a cool concept. In one of the books, he gets the symbols tattooed on his fingers so he does not have to take the time to draw them in the air. I may want to implement something like this, but I donâ€™t know if the meta quest controller can distinguish between different fingers like that. 

Project Parts: 

The map will most likely just be a simple arena, or maybe a simple level 

The only controller mapping will be the different spells you can cast, but you will probably still be able to use a sword or something 

Interaction: You can do things to cast spells and to attack enemies. I may also allow you do grab things depending on the difficulty of the programming. 

Environment Tracking: Collision with enemies and the terrain 

End point: will most likely just be a final boss enemy
